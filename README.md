standardArt
===========

A deviantArt Clone
------------------

standardArt is a project I started with the intention of creating a better deviantArt, one without the bad admins or the bad users. Alas, it was decided that the project is useless, as anything similar to deviantArt is doomed to failure. Here's the source for any of you who want to try it out.

Requirements
------------
- PHP (Tested with 5.3.4, may work with a greater or lesser version)
- MySQL 
- PHPMyAdmin, SQLBuddy, or good knowledge of the SQL prompt

Installation
------------

1. Move the source to a browser accessible directory
2. Import the file "standardart.sql" into your SQL database
3. Edit the file core/db.php and update your MySQL database and server info
4. Edit the file core/config.php and change the variable CORE_HOST to your server
5. Success!
